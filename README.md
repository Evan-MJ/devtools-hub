## For coding agents

- [`/api/tools`](https://tools.scoreroute.com/api/tools) - the catalogue (slug, name, description, tags, category) as JSON
- [`/llms.txt`](https://tools.scoreroute.com/llms.txt) - compact index of every tool
- [`/AGENTS.md`](https://tools.scoreroute.com/AGENTS.md) - how to cite a tool correctly
- [`/sitemap.xml`](https://tools.scoreroute.com/sitemap.xml) - every published URL

## Run it locally

```bash
npm install
npx wrangler pages dev .
```

`manifest.txt` is the single source of truth for the tool catalogue - a tool row is
`slug|category|featured|isnew|name|description|tags`. The Pages Functions read it at
request time, so adding a tool is one manifest line plus `tools/<slug>/index.html`.

## Deploy

**One command. Do not push to `main` by hand and do not open a PR by hand.**

```bash
git add -A && git commit -m "what changed"
bash scripts/publish.sh
```

It builds the site (52 local gates - a red build publishes nothing), pushes a
tree snapshot to `publish/snapshot`, opens a pull request, waits for the `gates`
check to go green, squash-merges it, waits for the Cloudflare Pages build to
succeed, runs a 406-check health pass against the live domain, verifies the
tool(s) this publish added, and prints the verdict. "Published" means the last
lines say `deployment ... success`, `health = green`, `new tool check = green`
and `gates ... PASS 52`.

Run it again with nothing changed and it stops at "tree unchanged -> not
pushing" without touching production.

Adding a tool is a manifest line plus `tools/<slug>/index.html`, then
`bash scripts/build.sh` before committing (the build regenerates the page's
head metadata and `.well-known/`), then commit and publish. Check one tool on
its own with `node scripts/verify-new-tool.js <slug>`.

`scripts/pre-deploy.sh` (direct `wrangler pages deploy`) and
`scripts/publish-github.sh` (snapshot only) are building blocks of that flow,
not entry points.

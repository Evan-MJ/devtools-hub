# Publish the current local main as a content snapshot to the GitHub mirror.
#
# Why a snapshot and not a normal push: the local history still contains the
# old `.dev.vars.example` with six live third-party keys (that is what
# GitHub's secret-scanning push protection rejects). Rewriting that history
# would rewrite other people's commits, so instead we publish the *tree* of
# local main as a fresh commit on top of whatever the mirror already has.
#
# The result: GitHub holds the current source of the live site (and, because
# the mirror is a public repository, its GitHub Actions minutes are free and
# unlimited), while the full history stays local where it belongs.
#
# Usage: ./scripts/publish-github.sh [remote-name]     (default: mirror)

# The published tree must be the tree that goes LIVE, not the committed HEAD.
#
# The build machine deploys the working tree (wrangler uploads the directory as it is),
# and the deploy gate rewrites files in place while it runs: tool-dates.json,
# sitemap.xml, llms.txt, llms-full.txt and the head metadata of every tool page. So
# "HEAD" and "what is deployed" are two different things, and publishing HEAD would
# publish a tree that differs from production — which, with the auto-deploy workflow
# (push to main -> deploy), rolls the live site back to the last commit.
#
# A temporary index gives the working tree's content without touching the real index
# and without committing anything: .gitignore still decides what is left out (.env,
# node_modules, the root harness scripts).

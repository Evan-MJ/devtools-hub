#
#   GitHub (Evan-MJ/devtools-hub, main)
#     -> Cloudflare Pages build: `npm ci --omit=dev && bash scripts/build.sh`
#     -> uploads dist/ as the static assets, compiles functions/ from the repo root
#
# It never deploys and never touches the network. Every gate below exits non-zero
# on failure, and a non-zero build command means Cloudflare keeps the previous
# deployment live — so a broken build can never reach production.
